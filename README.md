## Background and Overview

#### Motivation for project
  * Tetris is one of my mom's favorite games and a classic from my childhood.  
  * The reason I chose this project was to be able to share a coding creation with my mom.

A 4-day project that will focus on re-creating the classic game Tetris.  Time permitting, I also want to implement a “crazy-tris” which would have weirdly shaped pieces.

## Technologies
