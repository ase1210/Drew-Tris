## Background and Overview

#### Motivation for project
  * Tetris is one of my favorite games from my childhood and is also my mom’s favorite game.  
  * The reason I chose this project was to be able to share a coding creation with my mom.

This project will re-create the classic game Tetris.  Time permitting, I also want to implement a “crazy-tris” which would have weirdly shaped pieces.
