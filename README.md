## Background and Overview

Drew-Tris is a simple JavaScript game application that is modeled after the classic game Tetris. I wanted to see if I could re-create this classic game as well as my own Drew-Tris version in under 4 days. 

#### Motivation for project
  * Tetris is one of my mom's favorite games and a classic from my childhood.  
  * The reason I chose this project was to be able to share a coding creation with my mom.

## Technologies
  * Vanilla JavaScript with a focus on Object Oriented Programming  
  * HTML5 Canvas
  * DOM Manipulation  
  * Webpack
